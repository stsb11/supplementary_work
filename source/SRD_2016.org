- You've been using html and css to build your own web-pages.
- You can also use html and css to create logos and graphics for your web-page, but it's a little tricky to do without some help.
- Go to [[http://html-generator.weebly.com/css-shape-generator.html#007BFFy1z-76z-27z17z0][This html generator site]].
- Use the simple tools to create a graphic for your web-page. You can then copy and paste the generated html into a page of your own.
- There is no need to click any 'download' links on the page at any time; the code generated can be copied and pasted into one of your own web pages.
- *NOTE:* If you struggle to produce graphics with the tool, you can instead make a short web page about the history of the Internet, using HTML and some CSS.

- You have been learning to program text-based games this term.
- In one of the next lessons, you are going to create a text-based adventure game.
- The player of the game will be able to move North, South, East and West, pick up items and fight the bad guys.
- Sketch out a map of the environment for your game. It could be a haunted castle for instance, or the inside of a human body. Use your imagination.
- Label items that can be picked up by the player, and annotate to include where and how those items can be used.
- Label opponents that can be thwarted by the player.
- Your map must include a minimum of 8 different areas.

- You have been learning to build mechanisms this term.
- There are examples of linkages on [[https://bournetoinvent.com/projects/9-SC-Mechanisms/pages/3_Lesson.html][www.bournetoinvent.com]].
- Research 2 different types of linkages and their practical applications. Upload this to the [[http://www.bournetolearn.com][www.bournetolearn.com]] site for the platinum badge week 3.
- If you have completed this, go back to the previous badges and complete any unfinished theory tasks.

- Later this year you will be designing and building your own electric drag car.
- Electric cars have been around for many years; you will need to research this.
- Click on the link, [[https://bournetoinvent.com/projects/9-SC-Flyer/1.html][Bournetoinvent]], you will be able to read up on the history of the electric car.
- Complete the Silver and Gold badges for week 1, 'The Delport Flyer' and upload your work to [[http://www.bournetolearn.com][www.bournetolearn.com]].

- Open Scratch by clicking on [[https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/79700266/#editor][this]] link.
- Once inside the project, click the green flag icon (top-middle of screen) to run the program.
- Replace the 'Square' command with 'Pentagon', as directed on the page.
- *TASK:* Make the program draw a pentagon. Upload a screenshot of your code and of the shape.
- Swap the 'pentagon' command for 'pattern'. Think about how this works. 
- *TASK:* Modify the code to make a program to draw a pattern of your own.
   - You could have something made from 50 triangles
   - Or a square, then a pentagon one after the other before rotating a bit and repeating
   - Or you could change the pen colour a bit after each shape is drawn.
- Remember - you can't break anything, so don't be afraid to experiment.
- Upload a screenshot of your best pattern AND a shot of your code to BourneToLearn.
